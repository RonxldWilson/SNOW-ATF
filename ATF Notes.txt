ATF NOTES FOR MICRO CERTIFICATION ATF

ATF is good for:
1. Functional or functional business logic testing.
2. Regression testing
3. Browser Comp testing
4. Server Side Jasmine testing

ATF is not good for:
1. Load testing
2. Performance testing
3. Report testing
4. Email format testing

Building blocks of ATF:
1. Test suites : A test suite groups tests together that are typically performed one after the other. 
    Test suites represent a grouping of one or more tests or other test suites. The hierarchy of child test 
    suites can be to any level. The same test can be included within multiple test suites. However, a test 
    suite can only be assigned one parent test suite.
2. Tests: An ATF test represents a set of actions and assertions to verify an expected end result. 
    Each action or assertion within the test is represented by an individual test step. Although there 
    is no limit to the number of test steps contained within a test, it is typically better to create 
    smaller focused tests, rather than larger broad tests. 
    
    Note: When using an Agile development approach, an ATF test can be assigned to a Story.
    It represents an individual test case with a given acceptance criteria.
    
    Client and server:
    Some of the test steps within a test are performed on the client user interface, 
    while others are performed on the server. A single test can include both client and server actions and assertions. 
    Test steps performed on the client simulate user interactions, such as opening a form. 
    Test steps performed on the server execute in the background and cover a wide range of possibilities.

# Best Practice: Always create a user, give it roles, and then impersonate to ensure proper self-contained test W/O any dependencies.

3. Test steps: A test step represents a single action or assertion within a test, such as creating a user, 
    opening a form, or validating a field value. Different types of test steps are created using different 
    test step configurations. A test step configuration defines the behavior and characteristics of each 
    type of action or assertion.



ATF roles
1. Test Designer
2. Test Administrator
3. Web Service Tester

Note: ATF test suite can either be run on-demand or scheduled. ATF Test are only on-demand

Failure of a Test in a Test Suite can result in either complete haul or moving to the next test

# KEEP ATF OUT OF PRODUCTION

##Some of the important reasons ATF is prevented from running on their production instance include:
1. Running ATF tests slows down instance performance
2. Changes made within an ATF test would be visible to users before the rollback
3. Actionable events, such as email notifications to customers or approvals to managers, 
    would be triggered from data changed by ATF tests
4. Sensitive production data could be seen when impersonating a user
5. Audit history of data changes would remain even after data rollback

NOTE: Although ATF is not run in a production environment, ATF development objects are still promoted 
    into the production instance. This ensures they will be included when the production instance is 
    cloned down to the development or test instances. 

#Pointers
ATF quick start tests are predefined test which can reduce the development effort

Running ATF tests in parallel is NOT possible in a PDI
BUT
It is possible to run ATF in parallel in customer instance

Test runs are visible under: ATF> Run> Waiting/Running Test runs

Rollback Indepth:

1. Tables excluded from rollback
    Any records modified in the following tables are excluded from the rollback following 
    a test run. Emails and reports are typically excluded, so their content and styling can be checked manually.

    History [sys_history_line]
    ECC Queue [ecc_queue]
    Email [sys_email]
    Email Log [sys_email_log]
    Report Execution [report_executions]
    Report Stats [report_stats]
    or any table extending these tables

2. Tables excluded from rollback (Custom)

    Additional tables can be excluded from the rollback after a test run by adding an 
    excludedFromRollback=true Attribute to their Collection record in 
    
    System Definition> Dictionary
        Attributes
        Set Exclude from Rollback as True

3. Asynchronus Data Changes
    Some asynchronous changes are not always finished in time to be included within the 
    rollback following a test run. This would include things like event processing, 
    email notifications, and workflow updates. Do not rely on the rollback of asynchronous 
    changes to complete before the next test is run.


Adding Breakpoints to a test can help in debugging the ATF
If required it is possible to fill out a form when debugging a test

Just select the test step, right click and add Breakpoints to it


How to use Quick Start Guides
1. Go to ATF-> Tests
2. Then go to the particular quick start Guides
3. Set the scope of the application
4. Make a copy of the quick start
